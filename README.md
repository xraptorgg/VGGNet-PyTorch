# VGGNet implementation in PyTorch


This is an implementation of VGGNet architecture proposed by Karen Simonyan et al. in the paper [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) using PyTorch. The files contain implementations of both VGG-16 and VGG-19 architectures.

The Jupyter Notebook contains details about the architecture and implementation steps, the Python script contains the code.

The Jupyter Notebook and Python files also contain image pipeline for the Tiny ImageNet dataset, however I did not train the model on the dataset due to hardware limitations. If you wish to train the model using the Tiny ImageNet dataset then you should download it from [Tiny-ImageNet-200](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip), I did not include the dataset in the repository as it is quite large, however it is very straight forward to download and train the model after you download it, just mention the file path of the `tiny-imagenet-200` folder in the `DATA_PATH` in `main.py`.
